# 🚨 911 Emergency Call Analysis

A data science group project focused on analyzing 911 emergency call data using Python (EDA, ML, and statistical testing) and Power BI for visualization. This project was developed during a summer internship under the School of Computer Science and Engineering.

## 📌 Objective
To extract meaningful insights from real-world 911 call data to help public safety departments enhance emergency response planning through analysis, predictive modeling, and visual storytelling.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Dataset**: 911 emergency calls dataset (CSV)

## 🧠 Skills Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Testing (T-test, F-test, Chi-square)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Power BI Dashboard Development
- Team Collaboration & Documentation

## 🔍 Key Findings
- EMS calls are the most frequent, followed by Traffic and Fire.
- Mondays and daytime hours (9AM–4PM) are the peak periods for calls.
- Random Forest model provided the best classification performance.
- Power BI dashboard enables interactive analysis of emergency trends.

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
- Filters by **Date**, **Township**, and **Emergency Reason**
- Visual insights include heatmaps, trend lines, and KPI cards
- Helps users explore call volume, time trends, and geographic patterns

## 🧪 Statistical Insights
- T-test, F-test, and Chi-square tests validated call pattern differences.
- Significant variation found in call reasons across days and hours.
